# Introduction
This is a basic editor for Elastic Search' search DSL. 

Elastic Search allows you to write queries in JSON format. There are lots of options and this can be quite overwhelming. This editor 
provides autocomplete and syntax highlighting, making writing the JSON file a lot easier.

# Status
It is currently work in progress: most basic queries should work properly but it hasn't been tested extensively yet. If you have any 
feedback, don't hesitate to contact us!
